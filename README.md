THIS IS A LAND REGISTRY CONTRACT 
I FEEL THIS CONTRACT WAS GOING SOMEHWERE BUT IT DOES AS I WANT IT TO DO
BUT I DONT KNOW IF ITS THAT USEFUL 
ANYWAYS 
HERE IS THE BREAKDOWN

/************PROBLEM*********/
LETS SAY YOU ACQUIRE A HOUSE FROM A PARTICULARLY SHADY CHARACTER
AND YOU GET THE DEED TO THE HOUSE AND YOU AND YOUR FAMILY START LIVING THERE 
THEN BOOM TWO YEARS LATER SOME GUYS SHOW UP CLAIMING ITS THEIR HOUSE
BUT YOU HAVE THE DEED SO YOU ARE SAFE RIGHT?
TURNS OUT BOTH OF YOU HAVE THE SAME DEED NOW YOU ARE IN A DILEMA 
SO YOU SETTLE IT OUT IN COURT AND YOU BOTH LOSE OWNERSHIP OF THE HOUSE
TURNS OUT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN A HOUSE OWNERSHIP SCAM
SO HOW DO YOU SOLVE THIS ?

/************SOLUTION*********/
THE CONTRACT GOES LIKE THIS WHEN YOU ACQUIRE A HOUSE 
ITS AUTOMATICALLY SAVED AT THE REGISTRY AND THE DETAILS
ARE HASHED AND A MAPPING OF THE HOUSE ID IS ATTACHED TO IT
SO A USER CAN ACQUIRE MANY LANDS ALL WITH DIFFERENT ID AND HASHES
SO A USER CAN FIND OUT THE HASH OF AN HOUSE ID
AND IF THE USER WANTS TO ASCERTAIN IF THE USER IS THE RIGHTFUL OWNER
THE OWNER WILLRUN THE ID INTO THE LANDVERIFIER() FUNCTION
AND THE OUTPUT WILL CLARIFY
OR TO MAKE EXTRA SURE
YOU CAN MATCH THE LANDHASH WITH THE ID IS THE SHOWLANDHASH() FUNCTION

/************WHY I DID THIS *********/
WELL AM BORED 
ALSO 
WHAT IS A JUSTAWAY ? 

/************UNIT TESTS *********/
WELL I WROTE 13 TESTS AND ALL OF THEM PASSED
IS IT BUG FREE ? WELL THAT DEPENDS ON WHO IS ASKING
BUT EVERYTHING WORKS THE TESTS ALSO PASS
SO WHATELSE CAN GO WRONG 

*******NOTE***********

PLEASE USE FREELY NO STRINGS ATTACHED
AND I ALSO USE AN EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY TO CATCH REVERTS 
ITS CALLED execption.js
